# Intrusion-Kill-Chain-and-Courses-of-Action
A summary of the given topic.

**Intrusion-Kill-Chain:**
- A kill chain is a systematic way to confront an adversary and produce the desired results. In this research, a novel kill chain model for invasions is presented.
- It includes reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. 
- Email attachments, web sites and USB removable media are the most common delivery vectors for weaponized payloads by APT actors.
-  Increasingly, client application data files such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) or Microsoft Office documents serve as the weapon's payload.

**Courses-of-Action:**
- Intrusion kill chain becomes a model for actionable intelligence when defenders align enterprise capabilities to the specific processes an adversary undertakes to target that enterprise. 
- Defenders can measure the performance as well as the effectiveness of these actions, and plan investment roadmapsto rectify any capability gaps.
- Table 1 depicts a course of action matrix using the actions of detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, and depicts in the exploitation phase, for example, that host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) can passively Illustrating the spectrum of capabilities defenders can employ, the matrix includes traditional systems like network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and firewall access controladversaries that continually adapt their operations over time.particularly previously undisclosed “zero-day” exploits.
- Defenders can generate metrics of this resiliency by measuring the performance and effectiveness of their defenses against intruders.
- In December, defenders detect the weaponization and block the delivery but uncover a brand new, unmitigated, zero-day exploit in the process. In March, the adversary re-uses the same exploit, but evolves the weaponization technique and delivery infrastructure, circumventing detection and rendering By June, the defenders updated their capabilities sufficiently to have detections and mitigations layered from weaponization to C2. kill chain, defenders had the proper perspective of the relative effect of their defenses against the intrusion
